### Features
 * one click on cover pics to remove them
 * drag and drop pictures to reorganize display order

The rest of information, such as categories and different prices for different product properties (say, a phone with different memory size) has to be edited manually.

This token is available in the Chrome console, going to the Bibo market backend pages you'll see in the network tab some Ajax calls that contain the code token=bibo_65sdf54fddummydummy, copy it to your token.js
